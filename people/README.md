# Giants in Computer Vision and Machine Learning

This is aiming for a repository of the top Computer Vision and Machine Learning giants based on my own personal knowledge. 
You can check `ai_giants.md` for more details.
You can also use `python md2html.py` to generate the new ai_giants.html file.

In case of incorrect information, please feel free to provide a pull request here.

Besides my list, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) also provides a full list of top scholars in each research area.
