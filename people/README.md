Please check [ai_giants.md](https://github.com/yangyi02/awesome_ai/blob/master/people/ai_giants.md) for the list of giants in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

NOTE: This is simply a personal memory of the top Computer Vision and Machine Learning giants based on my own limited experience. Hence many top giants are not shown up in the list. 

In case of incorrect information, please feel free to modify [ai_giants.md](https://github.com/yangyi02/awesome_ai/blob/master/people/ai_giants.md) and provide a pull request. 

You can also use `python md2html.py` to generate [ai_giants.html](https://github.com/yangyi02/awesome_ai/blob/master/people/ai_giants.html).
